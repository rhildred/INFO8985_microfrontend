## Paypal Standard demo Microfrontend
### fastapi and vanilla javascript for custom element

TLDR;

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
fastapi dev app.py
```

You can see microfrontend docs by adding markdown files and refering to them in the `index.html`. You can see api docs by surfing to `/docs`. This is my response to Martin Fowler's [excellent article about micro frontends](https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html). You will notice that this article is from 2019. Unfortunately the promise of microfrontends and continuous delivery by autonomous teams still seems a little underdeveloped. I would like to develop it a little more!
